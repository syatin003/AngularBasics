   <h2>Custom Directives</h2>
    @*AngularJS application finds matching elements and does one-time activity using its compile() method of the custom directive.
         Then it processes the element using link() method of the custom directive based on the scope of the directive*@
    @*Custom directives are used in AngularJS to extend the functionality of HTML. They are defined using directive function.
         A custom directive simply replaces the element for which it is activated.*@

   @*AngularJS provides support to create custom directives for the following elements:

    Element directive - This activates when a matching element is encountered.

    Attribute - This activates when a matching attribute is encountered.

    CSS - This activates when a matching CSS style is encountered.

    Comment - Directive activates when a matching comment is encountered.*@

          directive.restrict = 'E';
