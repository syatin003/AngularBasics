    <title>AngularJS First Application</title>      @*AngularJS application mainly relies on controllers to control the flow of data in the application.
                                 A controller is defined using ng-controller directive.
                                A controller is a JavaScript object that contains attributes/properties, and functions.
                            Each controller accepts $scope as a parameter, which refers to the application/module that the controller needs to handle.*@
                                 @*ng-controller------- tells AngularJS which controller to use with this view.*@
