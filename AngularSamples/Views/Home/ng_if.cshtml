    <meta charset="UTF-8">@*The ngIf directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an {expression}. 
                              If the expression assigned to ngIf evaluates to a false value then the element is removed from the DOM,
                               otherwise a clone of the element is reinserted into the DOM.*@
    @*ngIf differs from ngShow and ngHide in that ngIf completely removes and recreates the element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the display css property.
         A common case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's position within the DOM, 
        such as the :first-child or :last-child pseudo-classes.*@
