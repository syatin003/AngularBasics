            If we put an Angular interpolation expression into such an attribute then the binding information would be lost when the browser removes the attribute. 
            The ngOpen directive solves this problem for the open attribute. 
            This complementary directive is not removed by the browser and so provides a permanent reliable place to store the binding information.*@
